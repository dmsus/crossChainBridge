# Functional Requirements

## Smart Contract Requirements

### FR.001 - Token Locking in Source Network
**Description:** The system must provide a smart contract with `lockTokens` function that allows users to lock tokens for cross-chain transfer. The function must validate sufficient balance, deduct tokens, and emit `TokensLocked` event.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Function signature: `lockTokens(uint256 amount, address targetAddress, uint256 targetChainId)`
- Balance validation before token deduction
- Emission of `TokensLocked` event with parameters: `user, amount, nonce, targetAddress, targetChainId`
- Nonce incrementation for each user transaction
- Revert on insufficient balance or zero amount

### FR.002 - Event Detection and Processing
**Description:** The relay service must continuously monitor `TokensLocked` events via WebSocket subscription. The system must process events in real-time and guarantee delivery.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- WebSocket connection to Ethereum Sepolia and Polygon Amoy nodes
- Real-time event listening with confirmation block depth (â‰¥12 blocks)
- Event parsing and validation of required parameters
- Connection failure handling with automatic reconnection
- Backup polling mechanism for missed events

### FR.003 - Signature Generation and Verification
**Description:** The system must generate cryptographic signatures to confirm transaction legitimacy. The target network smart contract must verify these signatures before token release.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- ECDSA signature generation using secp256k1 curve
- Signature over message: `user, amount, nonce, sourceChainId, targetChainId`
- Off-chain signature verification before submission
- Smart contract signature validation using ecrecover
- Protection against signature replay across chains

### FR.004 - Idempotent Processing
**Description:** The system must guarantee that each lock event is processed only once using database for tracking processed nonces.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Database table for processed events with unique constraints
- Nonce-based duplicate detection per user address
- Atomic transaction processing with database updates
- Audit logging of all processing attempts
- Automatic skipping of duplicate events with warning logs

## Relay Service Requirements

### FR.005 - Cross-Network Communication
**Description:** The relay must maintain simultaneous connections to both network nodes, process events from one network, and initiate transactions in the other.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Concurrent connection management to multiple blockchain networks
- Event processing pipeline with configurable workers
- Transaction lifecycle management (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Gas optimization and price estimation for target networks
- Network-specific configuration and adapters

### FR.006 - Monitoring and Logging
**Description:** The system must provide metrics for monitoring and detailed logging of all transaction processing stages.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Key metrics: transactions_processed, events_received, success_rate, processing_latency
- Health check endpoint at `/health` with component status
- Alerting integration for critical failures

### FR.007 - Error Handling and Retry Mechanism
**Description:** The system must properly handle temporary errors with exponential backoff retry. Critical errors must be escalated to the operator.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Exponential backoff retry for transient failures (max 5 attempts)
- Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed transactions
- Operator notifications via configured channels (email, Slack, etc.)
- Graceful degradation during network congestion

### FR.008 - Security Requirements
**Description:** The system must be protected against replay attacks, signature forgery, and nonce manipulation. Transfer amount limits and rate limiting must be implemented.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Replay protection using chain-specific nonces
- Rate limiting per user address (max 10 transactions/hour)
- Maximum transfer amount limits (configurable per token)
- Private key storage in secure environment (HSM or encrypted secrets)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Additional Requirements

### FR.009 - Administrative Functions
**Description:** The system must provide administrative controls for emergency situations and system management.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Emergency pause/resume functionality for bridge operations
- Fee configuration and updates without contract redeployment
- Operator role-based access control
- System configuration hot-reload capability
- Manual transaction override and recovery procedures

### FR.010 - Configuration and Key Management
**Description:** The system must support secure configuration management and private key handling.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Environment-based configuration with secure defaults
- Private key encryption at rest and in transit
- Key rotation procedures without service interruption
- Multi-signature support for high-value transactions
- Configuration validation on service startup

### FR.011 - Token Standards Compatibility
**Description:** The system must support standard token interfaces and be extensible for future standards.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- ERC-20 token standard support for both networks
- Configurable token mapping between networks
- Decimal handling and conversion between different token precision
- Upgradeable bridge contracts using proxy patterns
- Support for both mint/burn and lock/release token models

### FR.012 - Scalability and Performance
**Description:** The system must handle expected transaction volumes with defined performance characteristics.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Support for 100+ transactions per minute peak load
- Maximum 30 seconds processing latency from lock to release
- 99.9% service availability target
- Horizontal scaling capability for relay instances
- Database connection pooling and query optimization

### FR.013 - Recovery and Backup
**Description:** The system must include disaster recovery procedures and data backup mechanisms.

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery
- Private key backup and recovery procedures
- Emergency rollback procedures for contract upgrades
- Incident response playbooks for common failure scenarios
- Regular disaster recovery testing
